Mobility - Differential Drive Library

This repository contains a collection of classes and functions to
manipulate curves and trajectories that are relevant for driving a
simple differential drive robot using constant-velocity / curvature
segments. Most practical functions in this library are fairly well
tested in the real world. There is a great array of functions to
convert between curves (cord-length parameterized) and trajectories
(time parameterized), as well as slowing down, speeding up, enforcing
constraints, truncating, stitching, etc., in summary, it provides a
pretty complete toolbox for dealing with many practical realities
of motion planning for robotics.
